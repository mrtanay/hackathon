## Inspiration
As a student living in dorm, I am always hungry late night. I always like to have a snack/small meals. But whenever, I look in to ordering food from GrubHub or UberEats, I always have to pay and order a lot of unnecessary food because of the delivery charges and minimum order constraint respectively.

## What it does
It aggregates the food demands of the students in a specific marked region. It then orders the most popular demand of the students living in that particular area. The seller comes with an appropriate quantity at the common delivery point. The seller sells individual units such as pizza slices instead of the whole pie to each student who is willing to buy at a very cheap price.

## How we built it
We started off by by dividing the task in 3 parts, 1 person to build the front page and write the CSS file, 1 person to decide what database and APIs to use which will be used to store the user login credentials and information and what popular items are trending and the last person to figure out how to use Google Maps APIs to locate the aggregation radius of demand to order for delivery and also to locate the common point of delivery.

## Challenges we ran into
-Caching - Improving response time -Geo Location Accuracy -Clustering Analysis -Making Website Compatible on all platforms -Continuous Delivery: End to End Automation

## Accomplishments that we Are proud of
Developing unique application never seen before. Learning new technologies in such a short span of time.

## What we learned
-Fixing Caching -Understanding Geo Location -Figuring out how to do Clustering Analysis -Learned how to make website compatible on all platforms -Learning how to do integration testing
